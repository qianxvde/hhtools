"""Robot↔human retargeting calibration.

Establishes a one-time, per-robot alignment between:

* a known, reference-frame human pose (e.g. ``smpl`` T-pose,
  ``soma_bvh`` arms-down rest, or ``lafan_bvh`` near-T-pose), and
* the same robot posed via manually dialled actuated-joint angles with
  the floating base at identity.

When the user confirms the two poses match visually, a yaml file is
written as ``retarget_calibration_<reference>.yaml`` next to the URDF
(one calibration per robot **and** per reference format).  At
retarget time, per-canonical-joint scales + orientation offsets are
re-derived in closed form from the stored joint-angle configuration so
that the source motion's frame 0 lines up exactly with the robot's
calibrated pose.  Subsequent frames flow through the scaler as
"relative rotation from motion-frame-0 composed with the calibrated
orientation offset".

Compared to the ad-hoc first-frame heuristic this replaces, calibration
is explicit, inspectable (``git diff`` the YAML), and — once done per
robot — amortises across every source motion retargeted to that robot.
