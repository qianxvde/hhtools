"""Robot retarget calibration — dataclass, YAML IO, closed-form derivation.

Workflow at a glance
--------------------

1. **Capture** — the viewer's calibration mode lets the user dial
   actuated joint angles so the robot, at floating-base identity,
   visually matches a chosen reference human T-pose.  The resulting
   configuration is packaged into a :class:`RobotRetargetCalibration`
   and written next to the URDF as
   ``retarget_calibration_<reference>.yaml`` (one file per robot **and**
   per reference format: ``smpl``, ``lafan_bvh``, …) via
   :func:`save_calibration`.  Legacy ``retarget_calibration.yaml`` is
   still loaded when its embedded ``reference`` matches.

2. **Use** — at retarget time, :func:`build_scaler_config_from_calibration`
   reads that yaml, runs the URDF's forward kinematics at the stored
   joint configuration, and composes per-canonical-joint:

   * scalar scale = ``|robot_link_disp_from_root| / |ref_human_disp_from_root|``
     (both measured from the respective root: ``base_link`` for the
     robot, ``hips``/``pelvis`` for the reference human).  This
     captures anthropometric size differences.
   * orientation offset that, when chained with the source motion's
     frame-0 quaternion conjugate, lands the robot in its *calibrated*
     pose at motion frame 0 and then animates relative motion from
     there (identical semantics to the auto heuristic the user
     rejected as too fragile, only now the "target pose" is whatever
     the user dialled in — no longer a guess about SMPL conventions).
   * translation offset, in the joint's local (post-rotation) frame,
     that closes the residual after the scalar scale — non-zero when
     the robot's link direction doesn't line up with the reference
     human's radial direction from the root.

3. **Root yaw** — the only per-motion quantity we still derive is a
   yaw-preserving offset for the root joint so the retargeted robot
   starts facing the same direction the source human does.  Pitch /
   roll of the source root are absorbed into the offset (so the robot
   stays upright).

The stored YAML is intentionally minimal — just
``calibrated_joint_q`` + ``reference`` + ``robot`` — so humans can
``git diff`` it, and so a re-derivation runs fresh each time the
underlying URDF or reference code changes.  The derived parameters are
not cached; the closed-form computation is <1 ms per robot.

    Thin wrapper that extracts a rest-pose snapshot from ``clip`` and

    closed-form, origin-anchored builder that replaces the old
    hierarchical path.  At rest the scaled source effectors coincide
    exactly with the robot's calibrated link transforms (modulo the
    intentional vertical ground-align shift), so the IK solver sees
    zero residual on the first frame.

    Rest-pose selection is **source-format-dependent**:

    * **SMPL / SMPL-H / SMPL-X** (AMASS, HMR4D, Motion-X, …): uses
      :func:`~hhtools.retarget.newton_basic.rest_pose.rest_pose_from_motion_bind`
      which reconstructs the body-model's bind T-pose (all non-root
      local rotations = identity) from the clip's hierarchy.  This is
      essential because AMASS clips start in an arbitrary motion frame
      (e.g. mid-walk with arms hanging down), while the robot was
      calibrated against the SMPL T-pose reference (arms out).  Without
      this, the scaler computes large ``t_offset`` / ``q_offset`` values
      that force the scaled skeleton's arms to the T-pose level for the
      entire clip, regardless of the actual motion content.
    * **SOMA BVH**: bundled ``soma_zero_frame0.bvh`` rest
      (:func:`~hhtools.retarget.newton_basic.rest_pose.rest_pose_from_bundled_reference`)
      — the same file soma-retargeter ships.  Clip frame 0 is **not** used:
      SOMA clips often open mid-motion, and using frame 0 would bake the
      starting pose into the scaler instead of the format's canonical rest.
    * **LAFAN / GLB / other BVH**: frame-0 rest
      (:func:`~hhtools.retarget.newton_basic.rest_pose.rest_pose_from_motion`).

    """Closed-form :class:`ScalerConfig` that lines the source rest up with
    the robot's calibrated rest exactly at frame 0.

    This is the replacement for :func:`build_scaler_config_from_calibration`
    we arrived at after auditing the gaps between the hhtools pipeline
    and the ``soma-retargeter`` reference pipeline (whose RP1 output we
    use as ground truth).  The key change is **what the scaler's
    ``joint_offsets`` are solved for**:

    * Previously (hierarchical mode) the scaler silently discarded any
      ``q_offset`` and scaled source positions purely by bone-length
      ratio.  Consequence: IK rotation targets drifted free of the
      robot's frame, and the pipeline had to disable rotation
      objectives and fall back to a yaw-only pelvis constraint.
    * Here we solve the classic closed-form alignment used by
      ``soma_retargeter.robotics.human_to_robot_scaler`` — scale,
      ``q_offset``, ``t_offset`` — so that at rest::

          q_out[j, 0]  = q_src_rest[j] · q_offset[j] = q_rbt_rest[j]
          t_out[j, 0]  = scale[j] · p_src_rest[j]
                       + rotate(q_rbt_rest[j], t_offset[j])
                       = p_rbt_rest[j]

      giving zero IK residual at frame 0 *for every effector,
      including rotation targets*.  Subsequent frames ride on top of
      this rest alignment, so the IK only has to express per-frame
      deltas — exactly the regime it's most stable in.

    Parameters
    ----------
    calibration
        The hand-dialled robot↔human alignment (same object consumed by
        the hierarchical builder).
    model
        Loaded :class:`URDFRobotModel` — we run FK at
        ``calibration.calibrated_joint_q`` internally.
    rest_pose
        Source skeleton rest snapshot
        (see :class:`~hhtools.retarget.newton_basic.rest_pose.SourceRestPose`).
        For AMASS / SOMA, this is usually ``rest_pose_from_motion(clip)``
        with the clip's first frame; for unit tests it can come from
        ``rest_pose_from_reference(canonical)``.
    reference_motion
        Required when ``calibration.reference`` is ``glb`` —
        the same :class:`~hhtools.core.motion.Motion` whose frame-0
        skeleton was used during calibration.  Ignored for static references.
        :func:`build_scaler_config_from_calibration` passes ``clip`` here.
    src_to_canonical
        Optional override for the source-→-canonical alias map.  When
        not supplied we auto-detect via
        :func:`hhtools.retarget.newton_basic.human_aliases.auto_source_to_canonical`
        the same way the hierarchical builder does.

    Returns
    -------
    ScalerConfig
        In ``scale_anchor="root"`` mode (soma-compatible) with populated
        ``joint_scales`` + ``joint_offsets`` keyed by **source** bone
        names (so it drops into ``HumanToRobotScaler(hierarchy, cfg,
        human_height=rest_pose.height_m)`` without further alias work).

    Notes
    -----
    * ``scale[root] = 1.0`` — the root's position already moves with the
      subject's global translation at every frame; scaling it would
      double-compress the motion.  The rest-height mismatch between
      source and robot is picked up by ``root_z_offset`` (applied
      uniformly post-scale) so feet land on the ground.
    * ``scale[j]`` for non-root joints is the anthropometric bone-length
      ratio ``|robot_disp_from_root| / |src_disp_from_root|``.  At rest
      this, combined with the ``t_offset`` closure, makes the scaled
      target land exactly on the robot link.  At non-rest frames the
      scaled displacement preserves the same proportional body scaling
      soma-retargeter uses — tall subjects don't stretch a short robot
      past its reach.
    * Joints not in the robot's ``ik_map`` keep ``scale = 1.0`` and
      identity offsets (effectively pass-through).  They don't appear
      in the IK map, so their effector targets are never consumed, but
      we include them in ``joint_scales`` so the scaler can still be
      asked for their raw trajectories via
      :class:`~hhtools.retarget.newton_basic.scaler.ScaledEffectors`.
