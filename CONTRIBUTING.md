# Contributing to hhtools

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This project is in early alpha; feedback, bug reports,
and pull requests are all welcome.

## Development setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CAU-Qinghe/hhtools.git
cd hhtools
uv sync --extra all --extra dev
```

Run the linter:

```bash
ruff check hhtools
ruff format --check hhtools
```

## Code style

- Python 3.12+, `ruff` for linting and formatting (`line-length = 100`).
- Type-annotated public APIs.
- Every new module includes a module-level docstring.
- User-facing documentation lives in `README.md` (亮点与用法) and `framework.md` (框架与原理).
